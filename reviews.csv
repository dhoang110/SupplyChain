5 out of 5,Easy process and friendlier people,patrick,From my initial inquiry to securing a membership and vehicle loan (at a very competitive rate!) the process was smooth and easy. But the folks I dealt with (Casey and Chelsey) were outstanding. Quick and helpful replies and very great to work with. For the vehicle loan Chelsey made the preapproval process right through picking up the check about as easy as it can get. She even worked with the dealership on my behalf to keep them straight.,"June 27, 2023",2023-06-30,"Jul 3, 2023","Hi Patrick,Thank you for sharing your experience with us!

5 out of 5,EGCU Above and Beyond in Customer Service,Lisa Dominicus,"Today I had one of the best customer service experiences ever at EGCU. It was found my debit card had been compromised and needed to be replaced. I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family. Kudos to Evergreen Credit Union for providing stellar customer service and showing just how much they care about their patrons!","June 13, 2023",2023-06-14,"Jun 15, 2023","Hi Lisa,This is such a great experience!

5 out of 5,Long time Evergreen customers,Colin and Lisa Johnson,"We are long-time Evergreen CU customers, from our checking accounts, auto loans, and mortgages. We've completed several home purchases and refinances over the years, and find the loan servicing easy and reliable.  The Evergreen app allows us to transfer funds between accounts quickly, pay our mortgage, and check the status of deposits easily. We only wish there was another branch in the Scarborough/Saco area for convenience when we have in-person banking needs. Also wish their partnership with the Maine Mariners provided customers with perks, as we are Mariners fans. Thanks!","April 05, 2023",2023-04-05,"Apr 6, 2023","Good Day Colin and Lisa,Thank you so much for a great review and your time to write this up.  You offer some fantastic feedback.  Scarborough? Interesting possibility.  As for the Mariners, I have forwarded your thoughts to our marketing group.Regards,Paul LEvergreen Credit Union"

5 out of 5,Anne Deserves a Raise or At Least Better Snacks,MHT,"Anne could not have been more helpful. I have a mystery charge on my Apple account, because of course I do. Anne offered a few different options and helped me sort it out. I have been living in Massachusetts for seven years but I have stayed with Evergreen because of people like Anne. Unlike big banks, Evergreen is staffed by actual humans who live actual real-world lives. Evergreen staff are always professional and don’t always tell me what I want to hear. But at least they’re nice about it.","January 25, 2023",2023-01-25,"Jan 25, 2023",Good Afternoon Mary HopeThank you for your time to review Anne.  We are glad she was able to assist you.

4 out of 5,"""Convenience"" Fee",Tom,"Found out the hard way that business debit cards are set by default to allow you to go negative for basic in-store purchases vs normal debit cards that would deny the purchase. Lead to two $32 ""convenience"" fees for going -$11. Doesn't feel very convenient but at least they reversed one INSF fee for me. They also removed the option that allows the card to go negative for those basic in-store purchases.","April 28, 2022",2022-04-28,"May 5, 2022","Good Morning Tom,Thank you for your review.
