          "review_text": "If I could give them no stars I WOULD !!! DO NOT USE PNC BANK UNLESS YOU LIKE THEM GIVIBG YOUR MONEY AWAY !!! This is the worst bank and the dumbest people work here .  They lie about transactions \u2026. I paid a company and the money came out of my account.  But the company I paid said they declined the payment .  Which seems totally impossible because I moved money to the account just to pay a bill and to pay for services in advance because they gave me a discount.   Then the company called and said that they did release the money to them but then called me back shortly four hours later to let me know that they had reversed the charges and taking the money back from them.   But the money was still gone from my account\u2026\u2026\u2026 PNC gave me the runaround saying that I needed to dispute the charge so that they could get the money back which they already had it back.  I talked to five or six different people and every single person gave me a different excuse and a different solution.   The money was gone from my account for over six weeks and never paid to the company that I was trying to pay.    It took about 20 hours worth of calls to finally get someone that had the money put back in my account.   Then two weeks later the money was taken out again which overdrafted my account and cost me to incur many fees\u2026..   I even spoke to the company that they were supposed to pay and still to this day they\u2019ve never received one penny I have since then canceled service with them and signed up with someone else.    I spoke to someone and their executive offices today and they proceeded to tell me that the money was given to the other company but we called the other company yesterday on three-way with PNC and they told him at that time that still to this day they don\u2019t have the money from them and I\u2019ve close the account so I no longer need to pay them.   Now I see online that PNC is giving away $400 to new customers\u2026\u2026 and because I\u2019m an existing customer they\u2019re not worried about it they don\u2019t care they don\u2019t care that they\u2019ve caused me to have fees and I\u2019m probably gonna be evicted because they have kept my money and I wasn\u2019t able to pay my rent.  Do you think these people care that they\u2019re going to cause me to be evicted of course not !!   So unless you like your money being taken from you at any time for whatever they feel like then you should bank here but if you\u2019d like to keep your money and pay your own bills go somewheres else.   My husband is disabled and unable to work so the little bit of money that we get plus my pay it\u2019s just enough for us to pay our bills.   I\u2019m sick of talking to these line people that work there they keep on pretending like the company has the money that they gave it to them and that\u2019s a straight out lie I know this other company is trustworthy because I used to work there and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so embarrassing to me that this even happened",
