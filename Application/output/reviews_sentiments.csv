She proved incredibly nimble in this fluid market, offered great advice and remained very responsive.  I was able to shop for a vehicle with confidence. An invaluable thing when dealing with the occasional less than reputable sales types in a sellers market.

99,110,Evergreen Credit Union,"Overall a decent experience. My biggest complaint is the slowness of the company in general. I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up.

FYI go look at their website under “We Accept” . They have a picture of “cash on delivery” which includes Visa,Paypal, etc. But they only want you to pay with payment methods that offer you no protection. Look at the links.

360,1112,NorthOne,"Last month they started ""upgrading"" accounts. Ever since then, I've been locked out of my account for weeks. Their support number doesn't work. They don't answer chat messages or emails anymore. How on earth can a ""bank"" not have any line of communication with customers, lock them out of their accounts for weeks, offer no transparency with ""updates"", and act like everything is fine. For weeks they have been telling me the update would be complete and that access would be regained. I've filed complaints with the BBB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

373,1112,NorthOne,Extremely disappointing all around. Sign up was painful as their website is consistently very slow and when I needed help getting the account setup neither phone nor chat help was available. I eventually got the account set up with email assistance and was immediately smacked with their $10 fee. As I had just opened the account and was not feeling great about the experience so far I requested the $10 fee be waived for that first month. They apparently really like their $10 more than they do clients because they adamantly refused after repeated requests. I found every interaction with this company and its employees to be disappointing and am not at all surprised at the overwhelming number of negative reviews.

They immediately rejected the check ( no reason given) -cash was fine thou- and locked the account! Now the cash deposit is not available for withdrawal. they sent an email to answer alot of questions about my business. People, one of the questions was how do we get clients? - are you kidding me!!? Um, none of your business. They charged the 10.00 fee immediately upon depositing the cash . This appears to be a scam to charge a fee. My guess is they will hold the cash deposit and will finish ""the review"" after they charge more fees against the cash deposit. I only deposited 100.00 cash - which is now frozen. Imagine if you deposited a larger amount and then they just decide to block the account and its next to impossible to speak to someone. STAY AWAY. or your money could be frozen for no apparent reason and then they will ask you to answer 100 questions ( personal questions) about your business.

433,1112,NorthOne,"My account has been locked for 48 hours. I have not been able to talk to a person nor gotten any responses to the 8 emails I have sent to ""customer support"" I DO NOT recommend trusting NorthOne with your small business banking. I will never use an online only bank again. Its been a terrible experience and not worth $15/month in banks fees I was going to save. If you want access to your funds DO NOT trust NorthOne with them. They are liars, they replied once on Facebook that they emailed me. I guess its somewhat true I got 4 emails asking me to refer new customers to them. But 0 emails or communication regarding my locked account or their outright ignoring me for 48 hours. They will steal your money for no reason and ignore your attempts to contact them. On a side note its probably not great marketing to ask for referrals from someone you just stole money from and are now ignoring. But I did listen and have been giving feedback about how they stole my money are now ignoring me to anyone looking for a new bank. **** I deposited a business check from a fortune 500 company into my business checking account. 5 days after locking account they now want me to prove that check was actually paid to me. They want invoices, They asked how I got the check, like did I find it and randomly try cashing it? It's written to my business from a business there is no suspicious activity. Yet they come at me as though I stole the check and am cashing a check that isn't mine. More so than ever I believe NorthOne is a scam and out to hurt small business. DO NOT trust them with your money. I have no idea how long it will take me to prove my businesses money is mine and get it back. They will ignore you and make you jump through circus hoops to prove your money is yours.***** I still do not recommend NorthOne, my entire experience was terrible and their random locking of accounts for illegitimate and illegal reasons can destroy a small business. I received my check for the funds in my were in my account via 2 day UPS so they can get your money back to you in a timely manner. If you make enough noise.

442,1112,NorthOne,"Based on my experience thus far, NorthOne is shady, at best, and a total fraud, at worst. I signed up thinking this would be a great banking app for my marketing needs. Deposited $50 and a few hours later, they suspended my account. Asked me to provide supporting documentation, which I did. Today, they closed my account with no reason as to why. They haven't responded to my replies, and it appears they're attempting to keep my $50 deposit as there was no mention of returning it to me in their correspondence. I also acquired referral signups but they appear not to be honoring those, either.Update after NorthOne's reply: I've received this same canned response AFTER I made several attempts to find out why they pulled a ""bait and switch"" routine. NorthOne has offered nothing new in this canned reply. In fact, they offered even less today. In their replies to me after I repeatedly asked them for an explanation, they refused to give me specifics as to why they closed my account after accepting my deposit and approving my account. They sent me a link to their referral terms/conditions, which they just modified last week to state ""you can refer to close, personal friends and family only."" Meanwhile, NorthOne advertises their signup/referral bonuses on sites such as Swagbucks, so there's no reason to believe that referring their promotion is something they did not want. What's clear is that NorthOne DID NOT want to honor their signup or referral bonus offerings, as they duped countless people - myself included - into applying for an account and depositing $50, and then suspended and closed the accounts.. Meanwhile, they now have copies of my driver's license, my SSN and other sensitive information.NorthOne claims to have sent me a check after I repeatedly inquired about it. I asked for proof of this and they have yet to provide me any proof, and I have still not received a check.Update 11/17/21 - It's been 8 days since NorthOne told me they were sending me a check to refund the $50 I deposited when signing up. I haven't received the check, and I asked about it this morning, to which ""Paulie"" replied, ""we advise that you please review the Account Agreement from here.""Update 5/31/22 - I finally received my check weeks after having to demand it from Northone.  I truly believe they would've kept my deposit had I not fought tooth-and-nail to get it back.  I also found that my original review back in November was removed, and they've got several suspicious 5-star reviews which I believe are from employees.  There's also one 3-star review and their reply encouraged the reviewer to change it to 5-star.  Shady and desperate.  Despite them seemingly trying to stack the deck with fake 5-star reviews, the 1-star genuine reviews are still coming in on this company's shady business practices.Based on my experience, I strongly warn against doing business with this awful company.Update 6/4/22 - The reply they gave to this is the same canned reply they gave on my original review, which they somehow got removed, hence this re-review.  I spent weeks going back and forth with them via email.  Out of all the people I spoke to, there was only one rep who was actually apologetic over the situation and professional.  All the others were as ridiculous as their reply to this review is.",-0.7536,Negative
443,1112,NorthOne,"So I’m an online marketer/freelancer that partakes and earns income from multiple opportunities online, referring to family/friends. I joined this app a few days ago to use and refer to others as well; they were running a $75 referral bonus for each successful person who signs up and deposits $50. So I joined and followed those instructions and received a few sign ups. Then the next day I was emailed that my account was suspended til I could provide documentation about my business and answer some of their questions. Inconvenience considering my account was accepted already, but I did as they requested and provided my information, answered their questions, and sent payment proof that I do earn income online from my business and sent some social media links so they could see exactly what it is I do (even though I did explain) Fast forward to Today, my account is closed & I can’t access the app/login and the person I’ve been speaking to hasn’t provided me any legitimate reason as to WHY my account was closed. Like she doesn’t care; I had to mention I was going to the BBB (which I am) if I don’t receive my money! Only then after mentioning that, did she say they would mail me a check! I’m awaiting her response as of now… not sure if the check is only for my deposit or for my sign on bonus/referral pay as well. Because she didn’t mention so. Support is BAD. (At least with this woman it is) Us marketers know each other, we talk. This is unfair treatment, sketchy, stealing, & bad business. We did the work; least they could do is honor their referral program and pay us. So that’s why I give NorthOne Bank a 1 star.UPDATE 11/12/2021, after NorthOne’s reply: I received the exact same response from y’all that other’s have received; y’all have provided no additional info, simply copying & pasting scripts to everyone to make yourself seem professional, however still not answering our concerns as to why y’all are shutting down accounts left & right and not paying people what’s due to them; this is not good business! (PS, that link… yall modified last week AFTER I & others joined… stating, “you can refer to close, personal family and friends only” which is what I do!) So either way, I followed your rules, yet y’all don’t wanna honor your own referral program! That’s sad. Y’all ‘tricked’ a bunch of people, including myself, into joining & depositing $50 and then turn around and suspend & eventually shut down our accounts, AFTER we submit to y’all personal/sensitive info like our driver’s license and ssn! If that’s not suspicious I don’t know what is. Also! Y’all claim to have sent me a check (which I have not received & I’m still waiting on) And y’all haven’t even responded back to my email where I request a photo copy of the check (cause I wasn’t told how much the check would be for) and tracking. ? So I can send y’all details that y’all claim you need to help reinstate my account (tho y’all closed it)!! but y’all can’t send me proof of sending my check? What BS. Seems one sided, don’t it?

459,1112,NorthOne,"I signed up for NorthOne about a month ago.  All was going well until I was notified one day that my referral link had been removed and more information was requested about my business.  Confused about this I replied back to NorthOne that I had already provided the requested information during sign up and was only told, ""All banks occasionally review customer accounts..."".  I still found this odd, but complied with their request and provided the requested information the next day.  After I provided the information, I was told ""Your referral link has been removed and will not be reactivated"" in spite of me providing everything they asked for.  When I inquired why I was being treated with such disdain and accusatory nature, the support only replied that they could not tell me why my link was revoked, and simply referred me to their terms of service.  I read over the terms and nothing in them applied to me in any way.  This occurred after I referred two people who are also small business owners to the bank.  It appears they removed my link so that they would not have to pay the referral bonuses.  Having not broke ANY of their rules or terms this is the only logical explanation. I've never in my life seen such scamming tactics utilized by a legitimate bank.  It's shameful.edit: After reading some of the other reviews, I feel slightly better to know that I wasn't singled out and that  NorthOne is just an awful scam ridden bank.

I sold a piece of property for $100,000 I went with the check at 1:00 on Friday afternoon and was told the banker was out for lunch and to return later that afternoon. I did return that afternoon and waited awhile before being told come back Monday. The teller said she was having “issues”. All I needed was 5 minutes of her time to advise me. Promptly went to another bank that wasn't having “issues” and opened an account. Somethings you don't want to talk to a teller about especially when she is the only one and dividing her time between the drive-thru as well as working the counter. I fully realize that my $100 Grand is nothing to a bank worth billions but it's important to me. It's probably not her fault or the staff's fault but the lack of any help. Sorry I ever went to PNC. Planning to draw this account down and let this account slowly evaporate as I see from these reviews that it is almost impossible to close an account with PNC. I've lost the cost of the checks anyway! Thanks for the lesson PNC! I'll do more homework in the future!",0.6406,Positive

762,1118,PNC Bank,"I have been using many different credit cards for several decades. I pay my CC statements off in full and on time every month. The exceptions are when CC statements get lost in the mail and I don't catch it, which I almost always do because I keep a bill paying chart. I paid PNC credit card statement balance in full by phone on the due date with the automated system and it said my payment was accepted and on time. They still charged a late fee and refused to wave it. Mind you I have been a PNC bank customer for decades and had my PNC CC for over 6 years making payments on time and in full as described above. When an oops happens with any other CC they are happy to wave the fee because ""I am a valued customer"". But not PNC. They said the due date was 6pm on the due date for automated system phone payments (something no other credit card does), but midnight for online payments. I made my payment at 7pm with the automated system, which told me my payment was processed and on time. But even the mangers at PNC CC services refused to wave the late fee for a payment made on time. They clearly don't value their good customers. Expect lots of empty lip service about how they value your business but actions indicating they really don't. Needless to say I cancelled my PNC credit card after the conversation with managers today, and will take all my money out of PNC bank once I have made other arrangements. The bank has been pulling all its benefits, and adding lots of fees. I haven't had to pay any fees yet but they aren't paying me enough for my money in their bank and it is clear management there no longer values its customers either.

Falling victim to their deceitful practices was a devastating blow that I would never wish upon anyone.PNC Bank, a name associated with credibility, proved to be anything but trustworthy. Their false promises and unethical actions led to a significant loss of my hard-earned money. When I attempted to rectify the situation by contacting them, I was met with indifference and evasion.The lack of accountability and transparency from PNC Bank was nothing short of heartbreaking. They took advantage of my financial vulnerability and left me feeling helpless and disillusioned.In the midst of my despair, I discovered Kerose Limited. Their reputation for aiding victims of scams, even from well-established institutions like PNC Bank, gave me a glimmer of hope. Kerose Limited stepped in with a commitment to right the wrongs I had endured.Kerose Limited's involvement was a turning point. Their expertise, professionalism, and unwavering dedication led to the successful recovery of my stolen funds from PNC Bank. They guided me through the process, offered support, and ultimately helped me regain control over my finances.While PNC Bank's actions left me devastated and financially wounded, Kerose Limited provided a lifeline in my time of need.

When we signed up that was not an issue as we were told people cant control their direct deposit dates. Time for $400 to be deposited, Yup sorry you missed it by two days.

837,1118,PNC Bank,"I was originally lured in on an advertised personal loan application process with a 24 hour notice of approval. After waiting 3 days, I called PNC Bank to inquire as to the status of my application. The Representative informed me that the loan approval could take up to 5-7 business days. Disappointed, I begrudgingly waited. After more than 7 business days, I contacted the bank again, where I was then informed that my application was cancelled. Upon asking why, the Rep couldn't give me a clear answer but reassured me that my application would be reinstated. I again waited 3 more days before calling PNC Bank for the 3rd time. The Rep told me my application was still being processed. I asked if there was someone I could talk to in order to clarify the status of my loan. There was no common sense answer from the Rep, almost like I was being bamboozled. After waiting a total of 12 business days, I cancelled my loan application, still with no answer to how/why it took so long to get an answer on a $2000 personal loan for a person with a 800 credit score rating.

I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family.

You receive a generic email from the 'transport carrier' that US Customs is holding up your Asic miner and you need to pay thousands of dollars to have it released. Payment can only be made in crypto or bank wire. If you don't pay then the item will be return and according to asciminersrigs website you will read the following disclaimer...

I never heard back from them until I attempted to login to check and see if I could find out the status. Once logged in, they directed me to the option to make a deposit. So maybe they did approve my account?? I went through the deposit process and got the message that they needed to verify more information and that should be completed in 24 hours. That took 3 additional days.They have a number (332) 205-9253, and when you call it, it tells you to either make an appointment with a customer rep or email customer service.  I emailed them, and long story short, because my email wasn't the same as the one I applied with, they couldn't answer any questions. I explained the email that applied with was an alias to my business email address, and that I'd be happy to provide any other information they needed, or can I please talk to someone.  I was told the number is for customers only and that I need to email them from the email address that I applied for the account with.  I was frustrated. First, I waited days to get a reply. Then, when I logged in, I found that they were ready for me to go to the next step which was make a deposit -- only to be told that I will need to wait an additional 24 hours for whatever else they needed to verify... The 24 hours turned into 72. So, I needed to call my hosting company to get my email name changed, which I did. convoluted Once I did that, I called and requested they terminate the application.  I-am-done.",0.7839,Positive
