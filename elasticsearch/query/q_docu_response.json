Now, they sent me another balance transfer offer that said \u201cpre-approved\u201d. So I called in because could use it right now.  What do they do after I called and spent time on the phone signing up?! Flat out denied. Said some nonsense about status with Experian. I don\u2019t buy it and don\u2019t care. They had sent me a \u201cpre-approved\u201d offer, I spent my valuable time signing up, and get zero return.  This is absolutely, hands down THE worst banking company!
