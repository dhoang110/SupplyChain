Today is 7/15/23 I have a wire that I sent to myself to my other bank & I sent myself a deposit if I am unable to receive those funds just like the other reviewers for any reason, I will up date my review. If you take your time and search the company (North one reviews, North one scams) you will see how this bank as the potential to be dangerous and all of the victims who are not able to receive their money. You will never speak to CS, and if they close your account that means you are no longer  their customer so you only have access to emailing some one. You have been warned',\n",
