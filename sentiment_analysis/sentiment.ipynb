      "Review: I dislike PNC BANK very much.  First of all, on many occasions the ATM machines have issues.  Some nights they won't accept deposits, and other times you can't even withdraw your money.  Also, many of the branches ATM'S are in dark areas that are not well lit up and could be an accident waiting to happen.  I see a huge difference between them and Chase. I also just had my account hacked and PNC tried to blame me for one of the charges to Spectrum. They said because I use Spectrum that I must of did that charge. Really? I wasn't in Sacramento the day that person hacked my account.  PNC...do your jobs and dig a little deeper. You don't need to pin things on your customers. I am planning on closing my account soon enough.  I don't recommend PNC  bank.  They are horrible and have shotty customer service. The ATM'S always have issues, it's not a good place to do banking at all. My fiance banks with Key Bank and he loves it.\n",

      "Review: I wish  could give this bank a double zero.And let's get this straight.I only use this bank cause my state requires me to for my small business.If it wasn't for the state they would probably have no business.At least not mine.I have issues w them on a wklyl and sometimes twice a wk.Everything from broken ATM'sTo poor customer service kn the phone.you get absolutely no where with.nothing accomplished. Thanks for just wasting my time.Just talk circle around you.They allow double charges to go throw and wait 10days to get MY MONEY back.and I'm not talking peanuts.like $200But yet they grab that service fee w no problem in the begin of the month,for what yous don't do nothing.I tried to shop around to close this account.But there all the same.I diffently hate banks, and this is exactly why?It my hard earned money not yours.LEAVE IT ALONE.DONT TOUCH MY MONEY\n",

      "Review: We loved PNC prior to the pandemic. Once places started to reopen, PNC \"executives\" determined that not all branches need to have tellers. Of course, this affected the one by my office. You can only deposit at the ATM machine, & 50% of the time the ATM machine is down so you have to drive to another location. As soon as I get the OK from my boss, we will be shopping for a new banking relationship with another bank.\n",

      "Review: Aware we were almost done with the car payment we placed a call to ask for the pay-off amount to ensure we were sending the right amount.Last payment of $406.95 was made on 02/11/2022 (monthly payment was $380).As with other accounts we were waiting for the car title but never received so on 03/14/2022 another call was placed to ask them about the title. Customer service checked my account and after a few minutes I was told everything was in order that if I want the car title I need to request it at my county or local DMV.Recently I was notified that there was a event to my credit report which affected my credit score; when I checked my credit report I noticed the loan in question (PNC Bank/BBVA) is sending them a report as I owe them money. Like I owe them for March payment and this event is affecting my credit score negatively. I was never late to payments and I did my due diligence to call and ask for a pay-off amount. Wanting to clarify this situation I called again 04/15/22. On this day, I got transferred on multiple occasions and after a little over 2 hours I was told that it shows I owe money but that someone will call me to clarify the situation with me. Also my contract that i sign on 1/21/2016 stated that my monthly payment is $370.07 but them pnc change to $380.00 without explanation. If someone show up and repocess my car for this I will contact an attorney,  I still waiting for my tittle. I contact them numerous of time with no resolutionThis situation is not the best for customer satisfaction.I got a call from Lori Middendorf she was rude disrespectful and mean. I pay all my bill on time and they ruin my credit. I believe they did fraud to me. Very dissatisfied\n",

      "Review: I called to speak to a bank rep. After the call a pnc app appeared on my phone. I did not put it there. This same bank rep has been involved in changing my bank voicing code. I put it in when opening accounts and it did not work. He entered it on the computer. He gave me a new code. Now it works. Who put the app on my phone?\n",

      "Review: I have been a loyal PNC bank customer for 15+ years and have never experienced any issues. I have 3 accounts in my family and a credit card with PNC. This past week I was involved with a scam and was denied my dispute without even being asked for my documentation. They do not feel they have any need to protect their customers and make it very easy for these scams to take place. Aside from this, I have spoken with several customer service managers who made me feel like my business was not of value to them. One asked me \"so why exactly are you calling me?\" and one actually hung up on me. I will be closing ALL of my accounts with PNC and moving my business to my credit union who actually values it's customers.\n",

      "Review: I had an issue where someone went into the bank and cashed a check for $250.  I spoke with customer service and went into the bank.  They verified there was a check cashed and a check deposited (I deposited $250 to cover the withdrawn cash).  Now the \"executive complaint team\" is trying to tell me I only had a deposit for $250.  They sent me a statement that doesn't look like what I saw online. They claim to have sent me copies of the check but I have not received those copies.  Bottom line I'm out $250 and never want to deal with those people again.\n",

      "Review: They bought out our old bank, and automatically put me in an account that charges a monthly fee. When I called to see what could be done, I was on hold for an hour. The machine asked if I’d like a call back instead, I selected yes. I got a call back 2.5 hours later and no one could hear me, but I could hear OTHER people’s calls. Like their account info etc. I hung up and called back, when I never was able to speak to real person. I called my local branch and they escalated it. A woman from corporate left a message on my phone about the incident, I called and emailed her back repeatedly. She ghosted me. We’ve had nothing but problems with their online billing process, and recurring bills that we’ve set up experience issues almost every single month. Hate this bank with a passion.\n",
